use <variable(s)>               Declare what variables are being used.
forget <variable(s)>            Remove variables from 'use' list.

set <variable> <expression>     Set a variable equal to a function.
clear <variable(s)>             Clear a variable's value.
show <variable(s)>              Lists all variables and their values, if they
                                have one.

sub <expression> <variable(s)>  Substitutes specified variables and evaluates
                                the expression.
eval <expression>               Evaluates the expression without substitution,

                                variable arguments.
diff <expression> <variable>    Calculates the derivative of the expression
                                with respect to given variable.
